This documentation outlines the process of collecting historical stock data from Yahoo Finance and other relevant financial APIs for the Stock Prediction System. The collected data will serve as the foundation for analysis, trend identification, and prediction generation.

Data Sources
1. Yahoo Finance API
Overview
Endpoint: Yahoo Finance API
Purpose: Collect historical stock prices.
Access: Public API, no authentication required.
Usage Example
python
Copy code
import yfinance as yf

# Specify the stock symbol and date range
symbol = "AAPL"
start_date = "2022-01-01"
end_date = "2022-12-31"

# Fetch historical data
stock_data = yf.download(symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)

# Display the retrieved data
print(stock_data)


Cleaning and Dealing with Missing Data

Overview

Objective: Ensure the cleanliness of data and address missing values.
Tools: Utilizing the Pandas library in Python.
Example

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'stock_data' is the DataFrame obtained from Yahoo Finance
# Drop rows with missing values
cleaned_data = stock_data.dropna()

# Fill missing values with a specified value (e.g., 0)
filled_data = stock_data.fillna(0)

# Display the cleaned or filled data
print(cleaned_data)
print(filled_data)
Normalization and Scaling

Overview

Objective: Ensure data consistency and comparability.
Tools: Leveraging the Scikit-learn library in Python.
Example

python
Copy code
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Assuming 'stock_data' is the DataFrame
scaler = MinMaxScaler()

# Normalize the 'Close' column
stock_data['Close_normalized'] = scaler.fit_transform(stock_data[['Close']])

# Display the normalized data
print(stock_data[['Close', 'Close_normalized']])
Conclusion

This documentation furnishes an outline and instances of the preprocessing steps for historical stock data obtained from Yahoo Finance and other financial APIs. The data must undergo cleaning, handling missing values, normalization, and scaling to guarantee its suitability for subsequent analysis and prediction generation. Modify the provided code snippets according to the specific requirements and choices of APIs in your project.
