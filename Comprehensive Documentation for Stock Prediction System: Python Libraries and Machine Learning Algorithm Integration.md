# Overview


The Stock Prediction System is designed to analyze historical stock data and make predictions about future stock prices. This system utilizes various Python libraries for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. Additionally, a machine learning algorithm is employed to train on historical stock data and make predictions.
 
 
Python Libraries

1. Pandas
Description: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library. It provides data structures like DataFrame, which is essential for handling and manipulating time-series data, such as stock prices.

Usage:
import pandas as pd

2. NumPy
Description: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, which are crucial for numerical operations involved in stock data analysis.

Usage:
import numpy as np

3. Matplotlib and Seaborn
Description: Matplotlib and Seaborn are visualization libraries used for creating charts and graphs to visualize trends and patterns in stock data.

Usage:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
 
4. Scikit-learn
Description: Scikit-learn is a machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data analysis and modeling. It includes various algorithms for regression and classification tasks, which are suitable for stock price prediction.
 
Usage:
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
 
5. TensorFlow or PyTorch
Description: TensorFlow and PyTorch are deep learning libraries that can be used for building and training neural networks. These libraries are suitable for more complex stock price prediction models that involve deep learning techniques.
 
Usage:
import tensorflow as tf  # or import torch

6. Yahoo Finance API
Description: The Yahoo Finance API allows fetching historical stock data directly into Python. This data is crucial for training and testing the stock prediction model.

Usage:
from yfinance import download```
