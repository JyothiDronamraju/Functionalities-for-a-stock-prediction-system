Machine Learning Algorithm Implementation Documentation
Objective:
Implement machine learning algorithms for stock price prediction to enhance the capabilities of the Stock Prediction System.

Tools and Technologies:
Python
Machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
Steps:
1. Data Preparation:
Load and preprocess historical stock price data (as outlined in Data Collection and Data Preprocessing).
2. Feature Selection:
Use relevant features identified during Feature Engineering.
3. Machine Learning Model Selection:
a. Linear Regression:
python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
b. Decision Trees:
python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

model = DecisionTreeRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
c. Random Forests:
python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
4. Model Fine-tuning:
Evaluate and fine-tune models using appropriate metrics.
5. Training and Testing:
Split historical data into training and testing sets.
Establish a periodic retraining schedule.
